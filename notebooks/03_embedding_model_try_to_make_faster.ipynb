    "This notebook explores an alternative approach to the TF-IDF model by using word embeddings to represent the text data.\n",

    "## Project Goal\n",
    "Build a classifier to distinguish between real (1) and fake (0) news articles using word embeddings.\n",

    "## Workflow\n",
    "1. Load preprocessed training and testing data.\n",
    "2. Use a pre-trained language model from `spaCy` to generate document embeddings.\n",
    "3. Train multiple classification models on the embeddings.\n",
    "4. Evaluate and compare model performance against the TF-IDF models.\n",
    "5. Select the best performing model and save it."

    "**Observations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The TF-IDF models, especially Random Forest and SVM, achieved near-perfect scores, which is suspicious given the nature of the dataset.\n",
    "* The embedding-based models have lower scores, which might be a more realistic representation of the model's performance on unseen data.\n",
    "* The difference in performance suggests that the TF-IDF approach might be overfitting to the specific vocabulary of the training data.\n",
    "* The embedding-based approach, by capturing semantic meaning, might be more robust and generalize better, even with a lower score on this specific test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "While the TF-IDF models show higher metrics, the embedding-based models are likely to be more reliable in a real-world scenario. The choice between the two would depend on the specific goals of the project. If the goal is to have a model that understands the content better and is less susceptible to simple keyword manipulation, the embedding-based model is a better choice."
